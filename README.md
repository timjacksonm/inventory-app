## Summary

   <p>
My first real project with Node and Express. I was focused on learning CRUD functionality and understanding different http request. I definetly thought of better ideas to improve the app like creating a database of different shapes with really basic svgs that are downloadable. In the end I decided to keep it simple and learn what I needed so I can spend my time on future projects that are more in depth.
